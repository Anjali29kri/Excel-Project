# Road Accident Dashboard - Data Analysis Project

This project presents a comprehensive **Road Accident Dashboard** designed to analyze road accident data for different vehicle types, accident severity levels, and road conditions. The dashboard enables stakeholders to gain insights into accident patterns, casualty distribution, and high-risk areas to support data-driven decision-making for road safety improvements.

## Project Highlights
- Total **417,883 casualties** recorded in the dataset.
- **Fatal casualties:** 7,135 (1.7% of total)  
- **Serious casualties:** 59,312 (14.2%)  
- **Slight casualties:** 351,436 (84.1%)  
- Majority of casualties (79.8%) involved cars.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel** (for dashboard creation & visuals)
- Data visualization techniques (Donut charts, Line charts, Bar charts, Treemaps)
- KPI cards for quick metric insights

---

## Purpose
This dashboard aims to:
- Identify the most accident-prone vehicle types, road types, and conditions.
- Help government agencies and road safety organizations implement preventive measures.
- Compare accident trends year-over-year for better safety strategy planning.

---

## Insights Gained
- Cars are involved in the majority of accidents.
- Most accidents happen in daylight and on single carriageways.
- Rural areas have higher accident numbers than urban areas.
- Dry surface accidents dominate but wet conditions also contribute significantly.
- Accident trends remain consistent across years.
